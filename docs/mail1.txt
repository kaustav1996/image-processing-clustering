Subject: Report-2 on MUZZLE ANALYSIS for BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION

Dear Prof. Bandyopadhyay,

Please find attached a comprehensive report (Report-2) related to MUZZLE
ANALYSIS and its potential use primarily as a BIOMETRIC IDENTIFIER.

The report covers both angles from the physiological side as well as
signal processing. On one hand you will see several conjectures thrown
open towards the usage of certain patterns such as hair and pores present
on the MUZZLE. On the other side, it has been shown in this report, that
when these (not so apparent) pores and hairlike structures, are amplified
and made visible in a different domain (by creating a GRADIENT
SIGNIFICANCE MAP), then individual pig identification is possible.

Since the size of the dataset was small, an UN-SUPERVISED k-means
algorithm was used to organize a random mixture of MUZZLE PATTERNS.
Results were very promising.

With the availability of larger muzzle datasets and the exploration of
alternative features such as those based on contours it is possible to
scale this success.

This report will also be useful to the bio-scientists and doctors towards
honing in on the right choice of features.

Regards
Karthik
